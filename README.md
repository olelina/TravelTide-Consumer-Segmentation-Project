# TravelTide-Consumer-Segmentation-Project

### TravelTide is a rising travel e-booking startup launched in April 2021. The company has gained prominence in the online travel industry due to its cutting-edge data aggregation and search technology.
 ### However, its focus on creating the largest inventory and an easy search functionality has resulted in gaps in customer experience, leading to low retention. TravelTide CEO aims to address this by developing a marketing strategy rooted in understanding customer behavior.

### Business Request

#### Elena Tarrant, TravelTide's new Head of Marketing, and her goal is to create a personalized rewards program to boost customer loyalty. To succeed, she plans to rely on the data team for deep customer insights.

#### Elena wrote an email requesting the Data Analystsâ€™ support in identifying which perks are likely to resonate most with different customer segments to maximize customer engagement and drive sign-ups for the company new rewards program.

#### Together with the marketing team, we established criteria and filters to select active users for our analysis. 
Behavioral data take time to accumulate. Customers who signed up recently will have limited interactions compared to those who have been on the platform for years. Thus, we agreed to include users who had more than 7 sessions since January 4, 2023 as shown on the visualization here.

#### We have also analyzed only the trips that were booked and not cancelled by active users. 
The goal is to filter those users who are the most accurate representation of the TravelTide active and well-established customer.


### Here is the Lucidchart decision tree diagram that shows the logic behind the user groups segmentation
